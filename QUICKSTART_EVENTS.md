# Quick Start: Dividend & Earnings Events Tracker

## 1️⃣ Setup Alpha Vantage API Key

Run the setup script:
```bash
./setup_alpha_vantage.sh
```

Then enter your Alpha Vantage API key when prompted.

**Manual alternative:**
```bash
security add-generic-password \
  -a "mcp-portfolio-agent" \
  -s "alpha-vantage-api-key" \
  -w "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -U
```

## 2️⃣ Configure Stock Ticker Mappings

Edit `ticker_mapping.json` and add your stocks:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "Wise": "WISE.L",
    "Intel Corp": "INTC",
    "Apple Inc": "AAPL",
    "Microsoft Corporation": "MSFT",
    "ASML Holding": "ASML"
  }
}
```

**Tips:**
- Use exact stock names as they appear in your portfolio
- For European stocks, add exchange suffix: `.L` (London), `.PA` (Paris), `.AS` (Amsterdam)
- For US stocks, use standard ticker without suffix

## 3️⃣ Get Upcoming Events

Call the tool:
```
get_upcoming_events()

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### ❌ "API key not found"
→ Run `./setup_alpha_vantage.sh` to configure your key

### ❌ "Stock 'X' is not mapped"
→ Add the stock to `ticker_mapping.json`

### ❌ "No events found"
Possible reasons:
- Stocks not covered by Alpha Vantage
- No events scheduled in next 60 days
- European stock needs proper suffix (e.g., `.L`)

### ❌ "Rate limit reached"
→ Alpha Vantage has free tier limits. Wait a moment and retry.
